# CS262-Hw2-Clock
CS262 programming assignment 2. 
This assignment creates three virtual machines with different processing speed that can send message to each other. Our goal is to observe how the logical clock will evolve for different combination of clock speeds.

### How to run the code:
You can run simply run the `test.py` to get the test results. Outputs are generated in the log files `1.log`, `2.log`, `3.log`. Each contain the log of activities for its corresponding virtual machine. There are 2 parameters that you can play with: 
`(ticks1, ticks2, ticks3)` - 
`send_prob` -
